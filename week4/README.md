This week we focused on the case study presentation and did some explortion on the data
I focused on the marketing stratigies for the four different generated by our model:

Set the monthly goals of trading values.
Once they have achieved the goals, we can offer them products with less fees.
Encourage them to achieve the goals, instead of relying entirely on their own willing to trade and keep high trading.

Since average trading times is high, the accuracy for recommendation may be outstanding, so we apply more calculation.
Recommend products in best preference sector.
Providing personal recommendation can help remaining their high trading frequency. 

Everyone can communicate, share investment experiences and ideas.
Increase interaction with the GoTrade.
Professional ideas from high value trading users may interact new users.

and so on.
